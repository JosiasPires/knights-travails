# Knights Travails

The goal is to build a function `knightMoves(start, end)` that shows the shortest possible path a knight can take from one square to another on a standard 8×8 chessboard.
---
Each square is represented as coordinates `[x, y]`, where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 7`.  
The function should return an array of moves, including both the starting and ending positions.

### Example:
```js
knightMoves([0, 0], [1, 2]);
// => [[0, 0], [1, 2]]
